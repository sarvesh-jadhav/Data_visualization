# Data_visualization
In this task I have taken a sample dataset for data visualization using PowerBi tool
Steps:-
1) First step is to load the data, so I have loaded the data from excel which is 'sample_data'
2) Now once the data is loaded the next step is to select the appropriate chart, I have used many charts such as the barchart, linechart,columnchart etc depending on situations
3) To display it we have to click on any one chart, then there will be fields like x axis , y axis then we have to drag(Ex: country) and put it on x axis and otherone (Ex: boxes shipped) to y axis
4) Then we will get the graph, we change the color by going to visualiztion and in that we have to click 'format your visual' then go to-----> columns---> colors----> select any color you want
5) In the second chart(which is downwards) we used the bar chart where there is a scroller to scroll as it has huge amount of data rest same as the first chart
6) In the last chart we used the line chart, as we have to consider date and amount i.e amount fluctuations based on months rest same, and we will get the chart
7) After the line chart is displayed we observe that the price dropped on february and to check why it happened, we have to go to the point where it is dropped right click and there will be option analyze---> Explain the decrease-----> '+' by clicking this symbol the chart will be added displaying why it decreased for the month february.
